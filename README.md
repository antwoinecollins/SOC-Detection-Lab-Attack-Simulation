# SOC-Detection-Lab â€“ Attack Simulation

## Objective
The Attack Simulation project focused on generating and detecting attacks in a controlled environment.  
It provided hands-on experience in understanding adversary tactics and testing detection capabilities.

## Skills Learned
- Simulated attacks using Metasploit and other tools
- Generated telemetry for SIEM testing
- Identified detection gaps and improved rules
- Applied MITRE ATT&CK methodology for realistic scenarios
- Enhanced analytical and investigative skills

## Tools Used
- Metasploit
- Wireshark
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Splunk
- Elastic Stack
